##### The goal of this project in a distinctive way and easy to use and for all the screen sizes I used the color of light blue and dark blue and white and a little gray.


###### I wanted to introduce this legislator in a simplified way on how to develop technology since the creation of the first electronic device and until this moment I chose this topic because I am impressed with technology and  my experience In technology, the computer section there are types of programming languages and computer parts when clicked, will take you to the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"> Wikipedia </a>site to explain it as well as when you click any of the Social Media sites to our pages in sites.
